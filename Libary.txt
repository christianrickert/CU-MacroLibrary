 *  CU-MacroLibrary uses the Fiji image processing package exclusively â€“ there is no need
 *  to install additional plugins: You can simply edit or run this code by loading and
 *  executing it with the Macro plugin.
 *  To install the CU-MacroLibrary with your copy of ImageJ2, simply copy the "Library.txt"
 *  to "Fiji.app\macros" and its content will be available to any executed or installed macro.
 *  In addition, ImageJ2's macro editor will autocomplete functions provided by the library.
