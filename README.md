### Software requirements

* ImageJ2 app (>= 1.53e)
* Bio-Formats plugin (>= 6.4.0)

### Software installation
To install the CU-MacroLibrary with your copy of ImageJ2, simply copy the `Library.txt`
to `Fiji.app\macros` and its content will be available to any executed or installed macro.
In addition, ImageJ2's macro editor will autocomplete function names from the library.
